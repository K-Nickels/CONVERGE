# Campaigning for change

## CONVERGE Insights

* **Barriers to adoption -** Labs have the potential to uncover and prototype solutions based on a deep understanding of the complex systems they are working in, but translating these into practical change can be a challenge. Campaigns are outcome-focussed with strong practices of power analysis and political engagement. Could campaign mindsets help by embedding pathways to wide adoption of solutions into lab practice? 
* **We need to listen to people more and build constituencies** with distributed leadership behind our solutions. How can we invite people who arenâ€™t from the lab world or social innovation to be part of it from the beginning? 
* **Talking about power can be a taboo.** There is a need for trust and secure relationships to start conversations about power dynamics in labs.

## Present questions

* When is it right to embed campaign strategies into a lab? 
* Could campaigns also benefit from lab mindsets by injecting future-focussed thinking?

## **Provocations for your lab**

**Have the conversations about outside power early.** Who are your people? What are their powers? Can we understand and grow these? Who are the people in power that they know?
