# Campaigning for change

## CONVERGE Insights

* **Barriers to adoption -** Labs have the potential to uncover and prototype solutions based on a deep understanding of the complex systems they are working in, but translating these into practical change can be a challenge. Campaigns are outcome-focussed with strong practices of power analysis and political engagement. Could campaign mindsets help by embedding pathways to wide adoption of solutions into lab practice? 
* **We need to listen to people more and build constituencies** with distributed leadership behind our solutions. How can we invite people who arenâ€™t from the lab world or social innovation to be part of it from the beginning? 
* **Talking about power can be a taboo.** There is a need for trust and secure relationships to start conversations about power dynamics in labs.

## Present questions

* When is it right to embed campaign strategies into a lab? 
* Could campaigns also benefit from lab mindsets by injecting future-focussed thinking?

## **Provocations for your lab**

**Have the conversations about outside power early.** Who are your people? What are their powers? Can we understand and grow these? Who are the people in power that they know?

### **Building Outside Power and Narrative Change**

**Speakers : Tovah Paglaro, Darcy Riddell, Michelle German, Delyse Sylvester** 

Labs have the potential to surface and prototype promising solutions based on a deep understanding the complex systems they are working in, but translating those solutions into practical change is all too often a challenge. The focus on process design, relationships and solution generation in the lab can often take precedence over wider public engagement and cultivation of political pathways that make implementation more likely. Campaigns are outcome focused, with refined practices of power analysis and political engagement. In this session, we will consider how a campaign mindset might strengthen lab practice, by considering and embedding pathways to adoption into lab design and execution.
