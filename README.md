## Background

This handbook has been developed as a knowledge product of the [**CONVERGE Canadian Lab Practitioners Exchange**](https://radiussfu.com/converge-canadian-lab-practitioners-exchange/) ****hosted by [RADIUS SFU](https://radiussfu.com/) in Vancouver June 27-28. 130 lab practitioners and social innovation enablers came together for rich discussions as a field. This handbook contains a synthesis of those conversations, sharing the insights, questions and provocations our team believed would be useful to the Canadian labs field at large.

## Work in progress

It's hoped that this handbook won't be a static document, but rather a piece of collective infrastructure where developing knowledge from the Canadian labs field can be deposited. It's intended as a shared learning resource.
