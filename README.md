## Work in progress - feel free to edit and add!

It's intended that this handbook won't be a static document, but rather a piece of collective infrastructure where developing knowledge from the Canadian labs field can be deposited. It's intended as a shared learning resource. We chose to publish it on GitBook for it's integration with GitHub - the platform that powers the Open Source movement. 

So this Handbook is essentially Open Source. What does that mean? It means anyone can click the \[Edit on GitHub\] button on the top right of the screen and propose changes and additions to the handbook for our stewards to approve. For those of you who haven't used GitHub before, [here's a handy guide Enspiral created for people to contribute to their GitBook](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/contributing.html). 

If you've got something to add to the Handbook but using the process above don't work for you then you can feel free to email [chloe@humanfutureofwork.ca](mailto://chloe@humanfutureofwork.ca) and I'll add in your changes.

## Background

This handbook has been developed as a knowledge product of the [**CONVERGE Canadian Lab Practitioners Exchange**](https://radiussfu.com/converge-canadian-lab-practitioners-exchange/) ****hosted by [RADIUS SFU](https://radiussfu.com/) in Vancouver June 27-28. 130 lab practitioners and social innovation enablers came together for rich discussions as a field. This handbook contains a synthesis of those conversations, sharing the insights, questions and provocations our team believed would be useful to the Canadian labs field at large.
