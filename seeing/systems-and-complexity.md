# Systems & complexity

## CONVERGE Insights

* **Be context-sensitive -** understand that each tool has contexts in which they will and won’t work. 
* **Access to knowledge -** understand where the knowledge of the system is held. Who has access to it? Can you make that knowledge more accessible? 
* **Notice what’s missing -** gaps are information too. Connections and lack of them.

  Inside and outside - include both exterior and interior systems in your maps.

## Present questions

* How can we know which mapping system to use in which context? 
* How can we be accessible without being reductive? 
* How might we build a shared language and models with indigenous communities? 
* What are ways to get technical practice like systems mapping to resonate with everyone? Not just practitioners but also people with lived experience, funders and decision-makers?

## **Provocations for your lab**

**What and who are you including in your map?** Whose voice is included and excluded?  
  
**What are the different ways of knowing and experiencing systems?** How is your mapping process emphasizing masculine or left-brain ways of knowing based on data, information and abstract concepts vs feminine or right-brain ways of knowing based on intuition, emotion and artistic expression?
